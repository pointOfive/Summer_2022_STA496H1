Since our desire is to produce a (weighted) sample representation of the posterior, we do not immediately have an estimates for which variance reduction might apply; however, Bayesian credible intervals are based on percentile ranks within posterior samples, so might we expect variance reduction with respect to our estimates of Bayesian credible intervals? \n",
